In this project, green-screen or chroma key problem is discussed. We will be given an input image (e.g. Usain Bolt) with a green background. First, we will identify which parts of that image form the foreground (the mask) and which are the background (the key). We will replace the chroma key portion of the image with the corresponding portions of a new background image (e.g. eastereggs). This technique is frequently used in the TV, movie, and digital imaging industries.
Chroma key compositing, or chroma keying, is a visual effects/post-production technique for compositing (layering) two images or video streams together based on colour hues (chroma range). The technique has been used in many fields to remove a background from the subject of a photo or video â€“ particularly the newscasting, motion picture, and video game industries. A colour range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in video production and post-production.
